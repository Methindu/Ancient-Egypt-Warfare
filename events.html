        <h1>What Happened and how Was it Resolved</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
        <p>The battle of Kadesh was started by a desire to expand egyptian territory,
            in 1275 BCE, Rameses II was pharaoh and intended to follow expansionist policies.
            He chose to invade Hittie territory in Palestine, then pushed into Canaan.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
        <p>At the river of Orontes, the Egyptian army captured two men who clamed to
            be ex-Hittie, these men were actually hittie spies and gave false information 
            to the egyptians. They said that their army was far from Kadesh taking care of
            other business, the Egyptians were thrilled at this and decided to launch
            an attack and get this fight over with.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
        <p>While the Egyptian were expecting no army to fight with, Muwatallis had an army
            of 40,000 men and 3,000 chariots, much larger than Egypts 20,000 men and 2,000 chariots.
            Hittie chariots were also more heavy duty, which made it easy for them to take on
            the light Egyptian chariots.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
        <p>However, the Hitties made a terrible military error, rather than finishing the job,
            they chose to plunder (steal) from Egyptians instead. Rameses II was regrouping his
            army, ready to counter attack. The Hitties had lost the element of suprise, making
            them lose a big edge. Also, the Egyptians used their lightweight chariots to outmanouver
            the Hitties.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
        <p>The battle ended inconclusively, although Rameses would claim victory of the battle.
            15 years later after the death of Muwatallis, both parties signed the first ever
            peace treaty, today it is known as the treaty of Kadesh.
